code from <https://gopl.io> book, as i learn from it.

you should look at [github.com/adonovan/gopl.io](https://github.com/adonovan/gopl.io/) for the original code from the book.


will also include my own solution. all the code is likely to be typed by hand by me and you should not take this as a direct byte-to-byte copy from the book.
